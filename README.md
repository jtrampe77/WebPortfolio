## About me
I'm a Junior Web Developer graduate from Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. Over the course of my journey, Ive learned the fundamentals and advanced concepts for building elegant and responsive websites. I`ve had an experience as a Digital Marketing Intern at UW Insure Brokers, which gave me more in-depth knowledge about marketing websites. I also had the opportunity to work as a Junior Graphic Designer remotely at Wish USA which is located in Los Angeles, California.
